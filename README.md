## 🎛️ Recording Modes Deep Dive

### 🎵 **Single Note Recording**
Perfect for:
- Testing individual patches
- Recording specific notes for loops or one-shots
- Quick sampling workflow

**Workflow**:
1. Select the **Single Note** tab
2. Choose your MIDI note (C4, C#4, etc.)
3. Set velocity (1-127) for dynamics
4. Set duration (500-5000ms) for note length + release tail
5. Click **🔴 Record Sample**

**Output**: Single WAV file like `DW6000_C4_60_vel127.wav`

### 🎹 **Range Recording**
Perfect for:
- Creating complete instrument mappings
- Batch sampling entire synthesizer patches
- Building velocity-layered instruments

**Single Velocity Range**:
- Records one sample per note across your specified range
- Fastest way to capture an entire patch
- Example: C4-C6 = 25 samples in ~12 minutes

**Multi-Velocity Range** (Professional Feature):
- Records multiple velocity layers per note
- Creates dynamically responsive instruments
- Based on musical dynamics (pianissimo to fortissimo)

### 🎯 **Velocity Layer Details**

#### **2 Layers** (Quick & Effective)
- **Soft (64)**: Mellow, filtered character  
- **Loud (127)**: Bright, full harmonics
- **Use Case**: Simple on/off dynamic behavior

#### **3 Layers** (Professional Standard)
- **Soft (48)**: Pianissimo - very gentle
- **Medium (96)**: Mezzo-forte - balanced tone
- **Loud (127)**: Fortissimo - maximum power
- **Use Case**: Realistic dynamic response

#### **4 Layers** (Full Dynamic Range)
- **Very Soft (32)**: Pianissimo - barely audible attack
- **Soft (64)**: Piano - gentle playing
- **Medium (96)**: Forte - strong but controlled  
- **Loud (127)**: Fortissimo - maximum dynamics
- **Use Case**: Expressive performance instruments

#### **Custom Layers**
- Enter your own comma-separated velocities
- Example: `40,80,120` for 3 custom layers
- **Use Case**: Hardware-specific velocity curves

### 📁 **File Organization Examples**

#### **Single Velocity**:
```
Desktop/Batcherbird Samples/DW6000/
├── DW6000_C4_60_vel127.wav
├── DW6000_C#4_61_vel127.wav
├── DW6000_D4_62_vel127.wav
└── ...
```

#### **Multi-Velocity (3 Layers)**:
```
Desktop/Batcherbird Samples/DW6000/
├── DW6000_C4_60_vel048.wav
├── DW6000_C4_60_vel096.wav  
├── DW6000_C4_60_vel127.wav
├── DW6000_C#4_61_vel048.wav
├── DW6000_C#4_61_vel096.wav
├── DW6000_C#4_61_vel127.wav
└── ...
```

### ⏱️ **Recording Time Estimates**

| Range | Velocity Layers | Total Samples | Estimated Time* |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| C4-C6 (25 notes) | 1 | 25 | ~12 minutes |
| C4-C6 (25 notes) | 3 | 75 | ~37 minutes |
| C2-C7 (61 notes) | 1 | 61 | ~30 minutes |
| C2-C7 (61 notes) | 4 | 244 | ~2 hours |

*Based on 2000ms duration + 200ms delay between samples*

### 🎨 **Professional Tips**

#### **Velocity Response Testing**:
1. Start with **Single Note** to test your patch's velocity response
2. Record C4 at velocities 32, 64, 96, 127
3. Listen for timbral differences (not just volume)
4. Choose appropriate velocity layer count based on character changes

#### **Duration Settings**:
- **Percussive**: 1000-2000ms (short decay)
- **Sustained**: 3000-5000ms (long pads, strings)
- **Vintage Synth**: 2000ms (good balance for most patches)

#### **Hardware Optimization**:
- Use **MIDI Panic** if notes get stuck
- Longer delays for vintage gear (some need 500ms between notes)
- Test with **Preview** before full range recording

## 🏗️ Architecture

Batcherbird uses a unique **blocking command architecture** specifically designed for professional audio on macOS:

- **Core Audio Engine**: Rust-based sampling engine with sub-millisecond timing
- **Persistent Streams**: Single audio stream per recording session (prevents WAV corruption)
- **MIDI Safety**: Automatic panic messages prevent stuck notes
- **Thread-Safe**: Dedicated audio threads with channel communication

See [Technical Documentation](TAURI_AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Areas where we need help:

- **Linux Support**: Porting the audio engine to ALSA/JACK
- **Windows Support**: DirectSound/WASAPI implementation  
- **More Hardware Testing**: Expand our compatibility matrix
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Better visual design and workflow

See [IMPLEMENTATION_PRD.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PRD.md) for technical implementation details.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **macOS Only**: Currently supports macOS only (Linux/Windows planned for v0.3)
- **Audio Permission**: Requires microphone permission for recording
- **Export Formats**: Kontakt (.nki) and Decent Sampler (.dspreset) export planned for v0.2
